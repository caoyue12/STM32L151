Hologram test at cmd via ble：

1.ATI											//query firmware of NB-IOT chip

3.AT+COPS=1,0,"CHINA MOBILE",0					//register to your operator, query your operator whether supports hologram or not
4.AT+CREG?										//Check whether the device is registered on the network
5.AT+QNWINFO                       				// Query connected network information

7.AT+QICSGP=1,1,"hologram","","",1      		// Set APN network to hologram
8.AT+QIACT=1 									// Activate the APN network
9.AT+QIACT? 									// Query the APN assigned IP address
10.SEND,device_key,test data					//send data according to your device key,the length of test data is less than 100
												//this cmd will automatically send you data to server, just wait for 20s
